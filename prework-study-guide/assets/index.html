          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a "lin"k element placed in the HTML's "head"</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>the wild card symbol is for when we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page</li>
          <li>The header selector is for the top margin</li>
          <li>The footer selector is for the bottom margin</li>
          <li>we can also apply CSS rules to images</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>const keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned a value</li>
          <li>After the const keyword, we give the variable a name</li>
          <li>we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable</li>
          <li>console.log method outputs a message to the web console by adding an argument</li>
          <li>You link the JS file to the HTML file with in thee body of the HTML</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>The console is where you will see error messages related to the code</li>
          <li>if statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Code will only execute if the statement meets a condition</li>
          <li>we can have more than one condition by using else if</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>To create an array, you declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable with only one data item, instead of assigning the variable to a single value, we assign the variable to a group of values.</li>
          <li>arrays are zero-indexed and sequential</li>
          <li>indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>A for loop excutes specific task until a specified amount of times. at the same time variable tracking the iterations change as well</li>
          <li>We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named length</li>
          <li>a function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>To create a function, we use the function keyword. Then we give our function a unique name</li>
          <li>To call a function you must type NameOfTheFunction() along with any necissary argument within the parentheses</li>
